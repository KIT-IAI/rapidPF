# Getting started

Once you have [setup everything correctly](installation.md), the easiest way to get started, is to play with some implemented test cases.
Simply open and run `00_use-case/getting_started.m`.
This will open a GUI, from which you can select a case of your choice.
In addition, you can select the problem type, and the solver with which to solve the problem.

!!! note "External solvers"
    For Casadi and worhp to work you need to make sure they run on your machine.
